        <p>Limited Food Access Remains A Pressing Issue</p>

      <p>Food accessibility is a recurring issue throughout New York state. This is an issue that directly impacts the day-to-day lives of people. Food is a necessity for survival. Some people don’t have the same access to food that others do. This can lead to a lot of negative effects.</p>

      <p>In order to start to resolve this food accessibility issue, it is important to first understand county population size.</p>

      <iframe title="NY County Populations" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-ctouR" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ctouR/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="626" data-external="1"></iframe>

      <p>The most highly populated county in New York state is Kings. The U.S. Census reported that the population of Kings County is approximately 2,504,700. On the other hand, the least populated county in NY is Hamilton county at 4,836.</p>

      <p>When continuing to analyze the food access throughout NY state, it may be useful to refer back to this data to keep in perspective of the population as a whole and the size of the state.</p>

      <p>Breaking it down by county, the U.S. Department of Agriculture uses tracts as a measure of low accessibility. The United States Census Bureau says, “Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity.”</p>

      <p>Data suggests that Suffolk County has the lowest accessibility to food overall, at 470 tracts. The counties with the most accessibility to food include Schuyler County and Yates County, with both counties having 0 tracts.</p>

      <p>Suffolk County is the fifth most populated county in NY, with a population of 1,493,350. With a higher population, it may be more difficult to ensure proper food accessibility for all residents.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, both Yates County and Schuyler County are less densely populated.</p>

      <p>Breaking down these comparisons by miles to food, Suffolk County has a low access tract of 299 at a distance of 0.5 miles, 171 at 1 mile, and 0 at 10 miles. This data means that there is less food accessibility for people in a 0.5 mile range than a 1 mile range and likewise comparing 1 mile to 10 miles.</p>

      <p>Of the 10 counties with the lowest food access, only one county has limited access within a 10 mile range. Onondaga has a low access tract of 3 for 10 miles.</p>

      <p>Race can also have a significant impact on a person’s food accessibility. </p>

      <p>Assistant Professor of Sociology at Syracuse University, Sean Drake says, “racial segregation of neighborhoods leads to social, political, and economic isolation.” He says that the lack of investment in colored neighborhoods can lead to low food access for those residents.</p>

      <p>Professor Drake expects areas with higher percentages of Black and Latinx people would likely have the least accessibility. He says that food deserts are most likely to form in these types of areas.</p>

      <p>Professor Drake says “a food desert is a neighborhood or region with limited access to food options, and a lack in the variety of the options available.”</p>

      <div><iframe title="Race and Low Access" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-m1ZZp" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/m1ZZp/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="886" height="661" data-external="1"></iframe></div>

      <p>In NY state counties, more white people than people of any other race live further than 0.5 miles from food. They are flagged as low access due to this farther distance to food.</p>

      <p>However, other research <a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/minorities#:~:text=The%20relationship%20between%20SES%2C%20race,SES%2C%20race%2C%20and%20ethnicity" target="_blank">other research</a> suggests that white people tend to be of higher socioeconomic status than colored people. This means that white people likely have a higher probability of owning a car or having better access to transportation. Thus they can live further away from food because they have the resources to travel to get food. Whereas colored people with lower socioeconomic status may not have good transportation services and need to live closer to food.</p>

      <p>According to Professor Drake, it is likely that even though colored people live closer to food, they may have lower access in terms of variety. Further research is needed to confirm because the data doesn’t give enough information, but we can question whether the higher food accessibility for colored people includes healthy options or is limited to fast food and few healthier choices.</p>

      <p>This limited food access, especially for areas considered food deserts, which must meet certain criteria under the United States Department of Agriculture, can have immediate and lasting negative effects on people.</p>

      <p>Professor Drake says that “food deserts typically contain fewer healthy options, and can thus have a deleterious effect on the health of the local population.”</p>

      <p>Studies show that people with limited food access may be at higher risk of contracting a diet-related condition, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.</p>

      <p>Let it rain on the food deserts! How can you help reduce the effects of food deserts or limited food access? Professor Drake says that to resolve this limited food accessibility, we as a society should invest in Black and Latinx neighborhoods, “and give residents more varied, healthier options at a reasonable cost.”</p>
